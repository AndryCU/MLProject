This app uses a basic tensorflow model trained and designed by me to gain knowledge in this area. The objective is to classify an image of a pet in cat or dog. Use Jetpack Compose to create a very basic interface. The results that the app shows are very discreet, it needs a clear image of a cat or dog, which it classifies correctly.
